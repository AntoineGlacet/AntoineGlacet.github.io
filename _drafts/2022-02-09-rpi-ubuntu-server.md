# Set up the perfect Raspberry Pi Ubuntu server


Foreword: This guide simply describe how to set up a performant and reliable Ubuntu server on a Raspberry Pi. For about 50-150 USD you will have a fully functioning server that can be used as a media server, smart home hub, ad blocker, retro gaming station, personal hosting platform, and a huge array of other applications! It will also be a perfect introduction in the fascinating world of open source, IT and DIY.

## Hardware
### List
- Core:

| Option | Description | Cost |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- |
| Raspberry Pi            | Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 are fine depending on your budget.  | 35-75$ |
| Compatible power supply | Often sold with the Rpi. otherwise see recommendations.  | 0-10$ |
| SD card                 | To store the raspberry pi OS, not used after first boot if you do SSD mode (you should).| 10-30$ |
| A computer              | To setup the server. Any computer will do | out of budget |

- Optional (recommended for performance and reliability):

| Option | Description | Cost |
| ------ | ----------- |
| HDD                  | to store large quantity of files and media  | 50-70$ |
| SSD and USB adapter  | the SSD mode is really unleashing the full potential of Rpi as a server. see below  | 30-40$ |
| powered USB hub      | To store the raspberry pi OS, not used after first boot if you do SSD mode (you should).| 15-20$ |
| case + fan           | At this point, a case appreciable a fan can be useful too | 10-20$ | 

First off, you could choose to run a linux server on pretty much any hadware but a Raspberry Pi makes a great choice for a beginner. 

affordability, tutorials and resources, wide applications (GPIO pins), open source

In fact, I started my home server on a Rpi4, thinking I might upgrade to something beefier someday... This was 2 years ago at the time of writing and this same Rpi still serves me daily!
