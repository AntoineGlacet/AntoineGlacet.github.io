**tldr** at the end

I used [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout for a few days and I wanted to give a feedback as I am positively impressed with it. I also am looking for any improvements and tweaks done by other users to eventually integrate them before I finish burning  the layout in my brain.

# General impressions

I think although, it might be hard for a complete newbie to start with, once you know to touch type reasonably well, it is really worth it to give this layout system a go. Personally, I am using a [fortitude60](https://github.com/Pekaso/fortitude60), but you can try Miryoku with a wide range of keyboard. I think the benefits really shine when used with a ortho, 3key thumb cluster board  such as the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).

I am using a [Colemak]( {% link _drafts/switching-to-colemak.md %} ) layout with flipped layers, which means I have numbers, symbols and function on my left thumb/ right hand. This way, the learning for numbers and symbols have been easy.

my general impression is that is is an extremely efficient layout with a very reasonable learning curve. The very short travel distance and absence of finger contortions to do anything with the layout provides with a very comfortable and accurate typing experience!

After just 2-3 days of tweaking around and typing with Miryoku I achieve between 40-50 wpm on MonkeyType with Wikipedia source (for special characters). It was more or less my previous typing speed so I am glad. I also do a bit of programming and the symbols are not a problem, things like =+ or != are not a hassle and you get the hang of it pretty quickly.

Although,  I had a few pain points with Miryoku "vanilla" (especially for gaming, damn home mod rows!), the few tweaks below made this layout very easy to use.

One word on home row mods, I have read some people complaining about mistypes. IMO, if you use the settings of [Manna-harbour](https://www.reddit.com/user/manna_harbour/) (creator of Miryoku), it pose little to no problem of mistype. I use light switches and the only mistrigger I have is on my left pinky GUI (windows in my case) mod. I am thinking of solving that with a different timer for that specific key. once again, it happened very rarely and I am still learning the layout, it might just disappear as I get used to it.

Finally, the level of functionality the layout provides with media, mouse emulation navigation is really cool and super natural on such a compact layout. I did not use to use nav keys on my full size keyboard as it was as convenient to move my hand all the way to my mouse. Now that my hands are chilling on home row for anything, I use and abuse navigation and mouse emulation.

FYI, I type in English, French and some Japanese, no problem in any of those languages. (French is typed with US international and you get the hang of accents pretty quickly, even the dreaded Ãª).

# Tweaks
* [Word caps lock](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/caps-word/index.html)
A neat trick for a macro that activates the equivalent of caps lock, but which stops after a word.

* one-hand shortcuts

I added the shortcuts I most commonly use on my left hand unused layers (for me, it is NUM, SYM, FUN). This way it is more comfortable to use shortcuts with one hand on the mouse, especially useful for PowerPoint. Same could be achieved with home row mods and some finger contortion but this tweak really helps.

* gaming layers

This was kind of a deal breaker for me, I did not want to change keyboard for gaming and keeping some extra keys really bothered my. Gaming layers saved the day!

The concept that worked for me has been to:

\-  use only ALT, CTL and SFT mod on bottom row (z,x,c in qwerty), which allows me to use all home row and top row keys normally.

\-  assign keys to all unused keys on left hand for left thumb layers which provide for plenty of assignable keys for gaming!

with these 2 tweaks, gaming has actually become more ergonomic, and I should have improved (I am really unskilled, but it is another topic entirely).

I feel like there is much more to say, but you understood that Miryoku is in my opinion the perfect starting point for a compact keyboard layout. The simplicity, ergonomics and functionality is set so it should provide a satisfying experience to all the newcomers to the 40% keyboard.

I wished it was more mainstream so that I would not have been so scared to make the jump. (I use to see below 60% keyboard as gadgets with no practical use, if not for a few crazies who abuse combo. which I admired but could not relate to.)

sorry for the long post. so much to say about this Layout and 40% adoption in general

with love!

**tldr:** with a few tweaks for one-hand shortcuts and addition of gaming layers, it is absolutely amazing and certainly my endgame for typing, productivity and gaming. Although I still have to get the hang of the how row shift for series of capital letter, the comfort, accuracy and functionality of this layout is at a perfect point for me and for most 40% newcomers!
