# About this blog

I started thinking about writing a blog when people at work showed an interest in my self-made keyboard. It is such a vast topic, and there is only so much you can explain over coffee! I also wanted to have somewhere to host information I end up sharing regularly like setting up nice simple development environment for a colleague starting with Python or how to handle the proxy we have at work.

Finally I found out about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and realized I could do it for free, so here we are!

If this blog could achieve one thing, I hope it can be sharing the feeling of joy and empowerment from a successful project. Be it perfecting your wake up routine with home automation or bringing new insights at work with data science and ML, it feels good to have something working and pick up new skills along the way.

# About me

I am Antoine Glacet, native of the north of France, and have been living in Asia since 2014. Although I hold a Msc. in engineering, I did not really have any IT background before getting my first Raspberry Pi in 2016. Since then, I started spending a lot of my free time reading and learning about pretty much anything I found interesting or useful. From keyboards to machine learning, data science, docker and others...

My interests are varied and includes travelling, geeking and eating ramen inebriated.

My dislikes are specific and focused on obnoxiously loud motorcycle late at night (except if I am eating ramen).
